# Specifications for the main.py file:
# 1 point: The main.py file must import the entire checkers library.
import checkers
# 1 point: The code must check if itâ€™s running as main,
# and if so, call a function called game containing the main functionality, described next.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # 2 point: The game function will ask the user for the size of the board and will call the build_board function.
    # It will then print out the full board (you can just print the variable out; no need for extra formatting).
    # It will next print out how many empty cells, how many red cells, and how many black cells are in the board
    # using a function from your checkers.py file.
